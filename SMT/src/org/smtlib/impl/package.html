<BODY>
This package is an implementation of the interfaces defined in org.smtlib.  In particular, there are implementations of ISort, IPos (and ISource),
ICommand, IResponse, IExpr and its subtypes, along with factories
for all of these concrete classes; these implementations are independent of any concrete syntax.
