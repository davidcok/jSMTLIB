set-logic:
	- test each defined logic - types and function symbols
    - test axioms implicit in logics

assert
	- test that expressions conform to the logic

get-proof, get-value, get-assignment, get-unsat-core: not checking the errors
  when these are issued in an invalid location within the script

err_array2.tst - incomplete type checking for select and store functions

err_tokens.tst - needs better error messages

ok_getInfo3.tst - how to handle user info items
ok_getInfo2.tst
err_getInfo2.tst


err_getValue4.tst, err_getAssignment4.tst
ok_getProof.tst, ok_getAssignment.tst, ok_getValue.tst, ok_getUnsatCore.tst

CHECK: named expressions are implicit function definitions
CHECK: character use in various token types - all bad characters in keyword, quotesym, simple symbol

CHECK reason-unknwon when the reason is not unknown
CHECK reason-unkown, all-statistics when check-sat result is no longer valid

output channels - does not actually check that the output is sent to the named file, or that it is appended; does not check the diagnostic output at all

no testing of :expand-definitions

need to check that channel redirection works for adapters

check that non-printable characters are trapped

check that all whitespace is OK in strings and quoted symbols

test that the remainder of client-server return codes work
